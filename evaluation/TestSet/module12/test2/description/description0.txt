You are a professional Verilog hardware design expert, highly skilled in implementing both combinational and sequential circuits.
Your task is to analyze the provided circuit diagram (see image) and implement the corresponding Verilog RTL code. Please ensure that the code is syntactically correct and structurally clean.
<image>The diagram shows a 11-bit signed multiplier using the Booth algorithm. Its partial products are first compressed using CSAs and finally accumulated using Carry-Select Adder (C_Sel_A).
The module's interface is defined as follows:

module Multi_Booth_signed_odd #(
    parameter width=11
)(
    input wire [width:1] A,
    input wire [width:1] B,
    output wire [width*2:1] P
);
Please generate the complete Verilog code for this module.
