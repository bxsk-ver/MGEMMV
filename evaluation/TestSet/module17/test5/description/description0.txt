You are a professional Verilog hardware design expert, highly skilled in implementing both combinational and sequential circuits.
Your task is to analyze the provided circuit diagram (see image) and implement the corresponding Verilog RTL code. Please ensure that the code is syntactically correct and structurally clean.
<image>
The diagram shows a parallel multiplier for two 8-bit inputs, using the C_Skip_A adder architecture.
The module's interface is defined as follows:

module parallel_multiplier_8_C_Skip_A #(
    parameter width=8
)(
    input wire [width-1:0] A    ,
    input wire [width-1:0] B    ,
    output wire [width*2-1:0] S
);



Please generate the complete Verilog code for this module.
