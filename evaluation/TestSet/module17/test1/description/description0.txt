You are a professional Verilog hardware design expert, highly skilled in implementing both combinational and sequential circuits.
Your task is to analyze the provided circuit diagram (see image) and implement the corresponding Verilog RTL code. Please ensure that the code is syntactically correct and structurally clean.
<image>
The diagram shows a parallel multiplier for two 7-bit inputs, using the PPA_Kogge_Stone adder architecture.
The module's interface is defined as follows:

module parallel_multiplier_7_PPA_Kogge_Stone #(
    parameter width=7
)(
    input wire [width-1:0] A    ,
    input wire [width-1:0] B    ,
    output wire [width*2-1:0] S
);



Please generate the complete Verilog code for this module.
