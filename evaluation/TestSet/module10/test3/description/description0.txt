The diagram shows a signed adder tree with 7 inputs, each 17 bits wide, using the PPA_Brent_Kung architecture.
The module's interface is defined as follows:

module signed_addertree_17_7_PPA_Brent_Kung #(
    parameter width=17
)(
    input wire [width:1] A1,
    input wire [width:1] A2,
    input wire [width:1] A3,
    input wire [width:1] A4,
    input wire [width:1] A5,
    input wire [width:1] A6,
    input wire [width:1] A7,
    output wire [width + 3:1] S
);



Please generate the complete Verilog code for this module.
