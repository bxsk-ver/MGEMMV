You are a professional Verilog hardware design expert, highly skilled in implementing both combinational and sequential circuits.
Your task is to analyze the provided circuit diagram (see image) and implement the corresponding Verilog RTL code. Please ensure that the code is syntactically correct and structurally clean.
<image>
The diagram shows a Winograd transformation matrix of size 2, 3 that converts the Winograd output back to its original matrix form.
The module's interface is defined as follows:

module Wino_ATZA_22_23#(
    parameter data_width = 22
)(
    // din = 3 * 4
    input [data_width - 1:0] din0, din1, din2, din3, din4, din5, din6, din7, din8, din9, din10, din11,
    // dout = AT * dout * A
    output [data_width - 1:0] dout0, dout1, dout2, dout3
);


Please generate the complete Verilog code for this module.
