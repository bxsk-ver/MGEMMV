You are a professional Verilog hardware design expert, highly skilled in implementing both combinational and sequential circuits.
Your task is to analyze the provided circuit diagram (see image) and implement the corresponding Verilog RTL code. Please ensure that the code is syntactically correct and structurally clean.
<image>
The diagram shows a signed Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit with a bit width of 22 bits. It utilizes a Standard Multiplier (Multi) and a Carry Select Adder (C_Sel_A)with a bit width of 44 bits.
The module's interface is defined as follows:

module MAC_signed#(
    parameter width=22
    )(
    input wire [width:1] A,  
    input wire [width:1] B,  
    input wire [width*2:1] acc_in, 
    output wire [width*2+1:1] result
    );


Please generate the complete Verilog code for this module.
