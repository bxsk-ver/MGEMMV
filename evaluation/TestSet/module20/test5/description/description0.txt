The diagram shows a signed serial multiplier for two 8-bit inputs, using the PPA_Kogge_Stone adder architecture.
The module's interface is defined as follows:

module signed_serial_multiplier_8_PPA_Kogge_Stone #(
    parameter width=8
)(
    input wire           clk  ,
    input wire           rst_n,
    input wire           en   ,
    input wire [width-1:0] A    ,
    input wire [width-1:0] B    ,
    output reg           valid,
    output reg [width*2:1] S
);



Please generate the complete Verilog code for this module.
