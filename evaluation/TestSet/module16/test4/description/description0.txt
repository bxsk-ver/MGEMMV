The diagram shows an Booth multiplier for signed multiplication of two 9-bit inputs using the CLA adder architecture.
The module's interface is defined as follows:

module booth_multiplier_9_CLA #(
    parameter width=9
)(
    input wire [width:1] A,
    input wire [width:1] B,
    output wire [width*2:1] S
);


Please generate the complete Verilog code for this module.
