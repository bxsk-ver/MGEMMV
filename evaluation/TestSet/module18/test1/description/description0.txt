You are a professional Verilog hardware design expert, highly skilled in implementing both combinational and sequential circuits.
Your task is to analyze the provided circuit diagram (see image) and implement the corresponding Verilog RTL code. Please ensure that the code is syntactically correct and structurally clean.
<image>
The diagram shows a signed parallel multiplier for two 12-bit inputs, using the C_Sel_A adder architecture.
The module's interface is defined as follows:

module signed_parallel_multiplier_12_C_Sel_A #(
    parameter width=12
)(
    input wire [width-1:0] A    ,
    input wire [width-1:0] B    ,
    output wire [width*2-1:0] S
);



Please generate the complete Verilog code for this module.
