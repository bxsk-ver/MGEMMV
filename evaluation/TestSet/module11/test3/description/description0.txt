You are a professional Verilog hardware design expert, highly skilled in implementing both combinational and sequential circuits.
Your task is to analyze the provided circuit diagram (see image) and implement the corresponding Verilog RTL code. Please ensure that the code is syntactically correct and structurally clean.
<image>
The diagram shows an unsigned adder tree with 6 inputs, each 23 bits wide, using the PPA_Brent_Kung architecture.
The module's interface is defined as follows:

module addertree_23_6_PPA_Brent_Kung #(
    parameter width=23
)(
    input wire [width:1] A1,
    input wire [width:1] A2,
    input wire [width:1] A3,
    input wire [width:1] A4,
    input wire [width:1] A5,
    input wire [width:1] A6,
    output wire [width + 3:1] S
);



Please generate the complete Verilog code for this module.
