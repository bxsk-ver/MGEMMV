You are a professional Verilog hardware design expert, highly skilled in implementing both combinational and sequential circuits.
Your task is to analyze the provided circuit diagram (see image) and implement the corresponding Verilog RTL code. Please ensure that the code is syntactically correct and structurally clean.
<image>The diagram shows an unsigned adder tree using Carry-Save Adders (CSAs), capable of summing 4 numbers, each with a bit width of 17. The final layer uses Parallel Prefix Adder for Kogge_Stone (PPA_Kogge_Stone) for addition.
The module's interface is defined as follows:

module AdderTree_unsigned #(
    parameter width=17
)(
    input wire [width:1] A1,
    input wire [width:1] A2,
    input wire [width:1] A3,
    input wire [width:1] A4,
    output wire [width + 2:1] S
);
Please generate the complete Verilog code for this module.
